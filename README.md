## Overview

The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models). For more details about the data, refer to the [R documentation](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html).

In this analysis, we want to better understand the relationship between the given set of variables and miles per gallon. We also want to be able to answer a set of more specific questions, such as the following:

  1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG.
  2. Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions.
